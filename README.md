Excited to share a project from an internship program where I analyzed internship completion rates using Power BI.

This dashboard explores key success factors such as department, gender, and mentor interaction to uncover patterns in completions and dropouts.

I learned to connect datasets, design visual layouts, and interpret trends that can help improve future experiences.
